# Hello, I'm Reaz Ahammed ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong interest in competitive programming and problem-solving. I thoroughly enjoy participating in programming contests and challenging myself with algorithmic problems. I have actively participated in competitions such as ICPC and NCPC, where I have gained valuable experience in collaborative problem-solving and teamwork. Being the ICPC Asia West Continent Finalist 2021 has been a significant milestone in my competitive programming journey.

Apart from my dedication to competitive programming, I have a budding interest in exploring various areas of software development. I am continuously learning and expanding my skills in technologies like React Native for Android development and Java in Android Studio. While my experience in development is limited at this stage, I am eager to further develop my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
